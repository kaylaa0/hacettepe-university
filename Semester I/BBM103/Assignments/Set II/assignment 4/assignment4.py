#  Notes:
#       - This game provides a game over detection system.
#       - To break out of game simply write stop or exit or quit. Letter case independent.
#       - To see all available moves write show or moves or helpme. Letter case independent.
#       - To see all available command write help. Letter case independent
#       - Your input must be like 'x y' where x and y are integers and separated by one space. Otherwise you will be asked for input again and again.
#       - You will not receive error message except if your selection is in game's range but empty. You will just be asked for input again but the game does detect all type of errors separately, it just doesn't give errors because any change in output format might effect my grade.
