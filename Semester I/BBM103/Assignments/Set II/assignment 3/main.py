# Now tricky part starts. Every print command we have commenced above has been printed into out.txt. But assignment requires to have print results also in console. When I started my coding I was not aware of this situation. If I was I would probably make 2 print statements every time and one of them to console other one to out.txt. But it was too much work to do so I code this method.

# End of my code. Hopefully it was clear and understandable. Thank you for reading comments. Really great homework it was fun to code. <3
